# plantstress

This repository contains the source codes used for developing a machine-learning framework to predict heat stress in plants. Soil variables were used as features to predict the air temperature at the subsurface, which is input to a mathematical model to predict the heat stress. The machine learning model was developed using three algorithms: XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks(NN). The trained ML model developed in this work is suitable for quantization and deployment on an FPGA for use on a field device equipped with soil sensors. The heat stress metric is based on the inferred ambient temperature and duration of exposure to heat.
